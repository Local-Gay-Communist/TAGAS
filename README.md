TAGAS, or: 'Text Adventure Game And Stuff' is a text adventure game written entirely in C using standard libraries, don't @ me

current goals:
 - create *player* **struct**
 - create *room* **struct**
 - create *room* **descriptions**

am sick atm so it could take a while (although it always takes a while because autism + depression)
